Plan for Integrating JSON Analysis into Frontend
1. JSON Parsing Layer

Parse the JSON response from your analysis API.

Extract key objects:

keywords (with scores)

themes

personality_scores (with justification)

inferred_target_audience (demographics + psychographics)

2. Data Display Sections

Organize the analysis results into separate sections/cards for clarity:

Keyword Insights

Display as a list or as a tag cloud with score indicators.

Example: ‚Äúbanking (95%), financial services (93%), trust (88%)‚Äù.

Themes

Show as a simple bullet list.

Highlight the most frequent theme with a badge/label.

Personality Scores

Use a horizontal bar chart or radar chart to visualize scores (Sincerity, Excitement, Competence, Sophistication, Ruggedness).

Next to each score, show its justification as expandable text (tooltip or accordion).

Target Audience

Demographics block (age range, gender, income level).

Psychographics block (values, interests, lifestyle).

Present this in a profile card style to look like a marketing persona.

3. Visualization Features

Add donut charts or bar graphs (like the screenshot you shared) for:

Keyword Relevance Distribution (scores in %).

Personality Trait Strength (compare sincerity, competence, etc.).

Use colors consistent with your branding.

Add a legend to explain chart slices (like HTML, JS, CSS in your screenshot).

4. Integration with Preview Panel

In the Preview Your Billboard section (right side):

Auto-fill Brand Name, Location, Budget from the form.

Below the billboard mock, add a ‚ÄúBrand Analysis‚Äù expandable section that shows:

A chart (donut/radar) for personality scores.

A top-3 keyword list with confidence scores.

A short ‚ÄúInferred Audience Summary‚Äù sentence (generated from demographics + psychographics).

5. User Interaction Enhancements

Add tabs or collapsible panels so users can switch between:

Billboard Preview

Brand Insights (JSON parsed data)

Charts (visual breakdown)

Keep it lightweight so users can understand their brand profile at a glance.

üîπ Final Prompt (for your implementation)
‚ÄúShow my JSON brand analysis data in the frontend as structured cards and charts. Use donut/bar/radar charts to visualize keyword scores and personality traits. Create separate sections for Keywords, Themes, Personality Scores, and Target Audience. Add an expandable ‚ÄòBrand Insights‚Äô section under the billboard preview where users can view key insights at a glance, while also having the option to see full details in cards with charts and lists. Ensure each field from the JSON (scores, justifications, demographics, psychographics) is mapped to a visible UI element, not hidden in raw text.‚Äù
